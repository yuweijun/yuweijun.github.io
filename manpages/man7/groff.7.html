<H2>NAME</H2>

groff - a short reference for the GNU roff language

<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>


The name
<I>groff</I>

stands for
<I>GNU roff</I>

and is the free implementation of the roff type-setting system.
See
<B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?7+roff">roff</A></B>(7)

for a survey and the background of the groff system.

This document gives only short descriptions of the predefined roff
language elements as used in groff.
Both the classical features and the groff extensions are provided.

Historically, the
<I>roff language</I>

was called
<I>troff</I>.

<I>groff</I>

is compatible with the classical system and provides proper
extensions.
So in GNU, the terms
<I>roff</I>,

<I>troff</I>,

and
<I>groff language</I>

could be used as synonyms.
However
<I>troff</I>

slightly tends to refer more to the classical aspects, whereas
<I>groff</I>

emphasizes the GNU extensions, and
<I>roff</I>

is the general term for the language.

This file is only a short version of the complete documentation that
is found in the
<I>groff</I>

<B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?1+info">info</A></B>(1)

file, which contains more detailed, actual, and concise information.

The general syntax for writing groff documents is relatively easy, but
writing extensions to the roff language can be a bit harder.

The roff language is line-oriented.
There are only two kinds of lines, control lines and text lines.
The control lines start with a control character, by default a period







@m] &quot;@s]R]&quot;









or a single quote







@m] &quot;@s]R]&quot;









all other lines are text lines.

<B>Control lines</B>

represent commands, optionally with arguments.
They have the following syntax.
The leading control character can be followed by a command name;
arguments, if any, are separated by blanks from the command name and
among themselves, for example,
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>




</DL>


For indentation, any number of space or tab characters can be inserted
between the leading control character and the command name, but the
control character must be on the first position of the line.

<B>Text lines</B>

represent the parts that will be printed.
They can be modified by escape sequences, which are recognized by a
leading backslash







@m] &quot;@s]R]&quot;









These are in-line or even in-word formatting elements or functions.
Some of these take arguments separated by single quotes







@m] &quot;@s]R]&quot;









others are regulated by a length encoding introduced by an open
parenthesis







@m] &quot;@s]R]&quot;









or enclosed in brackets







@m] &quot;@s]R]&quot;









and







@m] &quot;@s]R]&quot;










The roff language provides flexible instruments for writing language
extension, such as macros.
When interpreting macro definitions, the roff system enters a special
operating mode, called the
<B>copy mode</B>.


The copy mode behavior can be quite tricky, but there are some rules
that ensure a safe usage.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.<DD>
Printable backslashes must be denoted as






To be more precise,






represents the current escape character.
To get a backslash glyph, use






or






<DT>2.<DD>
Double all backslashes.
<DT>3.<DD>
Begin all text lines with the special non-spacing character







This does not produce the most efficient code, but it should work as a
first measure.
For better strategies, see the groff info file and
<B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?5+groff_tmac">groff_tmac</A></B>(5).


Reading roff source files is easier, just reduce all double backslashes
to a single one in all macro definitions.

</DL>
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>GROFF ELEMENTS</H2>


The roff language elements add formatting information to a text file.
The fundamental elements are predefined commands and variables that
make roff a full-blown programming language.

There are two kinds of roff commands, possibly with arguments.
<B>Requests</B>

are written on a line of their own starting with a dot







@m] &quot;@s]R]&quot;









or a







@m] &quot;@s]R]&quot;









whereas
<B>Escape sequences</B>

are in-line functions and in-word formatting elements starting with a
backslash







@m] &quot;@s]R]&quot;










The user can define her own formatting commands using the




<B>ייג=if</B>


request.
These commands are called
<B>macros</B>,

but they are used exactly like requests.
Macro packages are pre-defined sets of macros written in the groff
language.
A user's possibilities to create escape sequences herself is very
limited, only special characters can be mapped.

The groff language provides several kinds of variables with
different interfaces.
There are pre-defined variables, but the user can define her own
variables as well.

<B>String</B>

variables store character sequences.
They are set with the




<B>ייג=if</B>


request and retrieved by the






escape sequences.
Strings can have variables.

<B>Register</B>

variables can store numerical values, numbers with a scale unit, and
occasionally string-like objects.
They are set with the




<B>ייג=if</B>


request and retrieved by the






escape sequences.

<B>Environments</B>

allow the user to temporarily store global formatting parameters like
line length, font size, etc. for later reuse.
This is done by the




<B>ייג=if</B>


request.

<B>Fonts</B>

are identified either by a name or by an internal number.
The current font is chosen by the




<B>ייג=if</B>


request or by the






escape sequences.
Each device has special fonts, but the following fonts are available
for all devices.
<B>R</B>

is the standard font Roman.
<B>B</B>

is its
<B>bold</B>

counterpart.
The
<I>italic</I>

font is called
<B>I</B>

and is available everywhere, but on text devices it is displayed as an
underlined Roman font.
For the graphical output devices, there exist constant-width pendants
of these fonts,
<B>CR</B>,

<B>CI</B>,

and
<B>CB</B>.

On text devices, all characters have a constant width anyway.

Moreover, there are some advanced roff elements.
A
<B>diversion</B>

stores information into a macro for later usage.
A
<B>trap</B>

is a positional condition like a certain number of lines from page top
or in a diversion or in the input.
Some action can be prescribed to be run automatically when the
condition is met.

More detailed information and examples can be found in the groff info
file.

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONTROL CHARACTERS</H2>


There is a small set of characters that have a special controlling
task in certain conditions.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>





@m] &quot;@s]R]&quot;








<DD>
A dot is only special at the beginning of a line or after the
condition in the requests




<B>ייג=if</B>






<B>ייג=if</B>






<B>ייג=if</B>


and




<B>ייג=if</B>


There it is the control character that introduces a request (or macro).
The special behavior can be delayed by using the






escape.
By using the 




<B>ייג=if</B>


request, the control character can be set to a different character,
making the dot







@m] &quot;@s]R]&quot;









a non-special character.
<DT><DD>
In all other positions, it just means a dot character.
In text paragraphs, it is advantageous to start each sentence at a
line of its own.
<DT>





@m] &quot;@s]R]&quot;








<DD>
The single quote has two controlling tasks.
At the beginning of a line and in the conditional requests it is the
non-breaking control character.
That means that it introduces a request like the dot, but with the
additional property that this request doesn't cause a linebreak.
By using the 




<B>ייג=if</B>


request, the non-break control character can be set to a different
character.
<DT><DD>
As a second task, it is the most commonly used argument separator in
some functional escape sequences (but any pair of characters not part
of the argument will work).
In all other positions, it denotes the single quote or apostrophe
character.
Groff provides a printable representation with the






escape sequence.
<DT>





@m] &quot;@s]R]&quot;








<DD>
The double quote is used to enclose arguments in requests, macros, and
strings.
In the




<B>ייג=if</B>


and




<B>ייג=if</B>


requests, a leading double quote in the argument will be stripped off,
making everything else afterwards the string to be defined (enabling
leading whitespace).
The escaped double quote






introduces a comment.
Otherwise, it is not special.
Groff provides a printable representation with the






escape sequence.
<DT>





@m] &quot;@s]R]&quot;








<DD>
The backslash usually introduces an escape sequence (this can be
changed with the




<B>ייג=if</B>


request).
A printed version of the escape character is the






escape; a backslash glyph can be obtained by






<DT>





@m] &quot;@s]R]&quot;








<DD>
The open parenthesis is only special in escape sequences when
introducing an escape name or argument consisting of exactly two
characters.
In groff, this behavior can be replaced by the CB][]] construct.
<DT>





@m] &quot;@s]R]&quot;








<DD>
The opening bracket is only special in groff escape sequences; there
it is used to introduce a long escape name or long escape argument.
Otherwise, it is non-special, e.g. in macro calls.
<DT>





@m] &quot;@s]R]&quot;








<DD>
The closing bracket is only special in groff escape sequences; there
it terminates a long escape name or long escape argument.
Otherwise, it is non-special.
<DT>CI]space]<DD>
Space characters are only functional characters.
They separate the arguments in requests, macros, and strings, and the words
in text lines.
They are subject to groff's horizontal spacing calculations.
To get a defined space width, escape sequences like







@m] &quot;@s]R]&quot;









(this is the escape character followed by a space),












or






should be used.
<DT>CI]newline]<DD>
In text paragraphs, newlines mostly behave like space characters.
Continuation lines can be specified by an escaped newline, i.e., by
specifying a backslash







@m] &quot;@s]R]&quot;









as the last character of a line.
<DT>CI]tab]<DD>
If a tab character occurs during text the interpreter makes a
horizontal jump to the next pre-defined tab position.
There is a sophisticated interface for handling tab positions.

<H2>NUMERICAL EXPRESSIONS</H2>


A
<B>numerical value</B>

is a signed or unsigned integer or float with or without an appended
scaling indicator.
A
<B>scaling indicator</B>

is a one-character abbreviation for a unit of measurement.
A number followed by a scaling indicator signifies a size value.
By default, numerical values do not have a scaling indicator, i.e., they
are normal numbers.

The
<I>roff</I>

language defines the following scaling indicators.

<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>REQUESTS</H2>


This section provides a short reference for the predefined requests.
In groff, request and macro names can be arbitrarily long.
No bracketing or marking of long names is needed.

Most requests take one or more arguments.
The arguments are separated by space characters (no tabs!); there is
no inherent limit for their length or number.
An argument can be enclosed by a pair of double quotes.
This is very handy if an argument contains space characters, e.g.,
[dq]<I>arg with space</I>[dq]

denotes a single argument.

Some requests have optional arguments with a different behaviour.
Not all of these details are outlined here.
Refer to the groff info file and
<B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?7+groff_diff">groff_diff</A></B>(7)

for all details.

In the following request specifications, most argument names were
chosen to be descriptive.
Only the following denotations need clarification.


<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>c</I>

<DD>
denotes a single character.
<DT><I>font</I>

<DD>
a font either specified as a font name or a font number.
<DT><I>anything</I>

<DD>
all characters up to the end of the line or within






and






<DT><I>n</I>

<DD>
is a numerical expression that evaluates to an integer value.
<DT><I>N</I>

<DD>
is an arbitrary numerical expression, signed or unsigned.
<DT><I>[+-]N</I>

<DD>
has three meanings depending on its sign, described below.
</DL>
</DL>



If an expression defined as
<I>[+-]N</I>

starts with a







@m] &quot;@s]R]&quot;









sign the resulting value of the expression will be added to an already
existing value inherent to the related request, e.g. adding to a number
register.
If the expression starts with a







@m] &quot;@s]R]&quot;









the value of the expression will be subtracted from the request value.

Without a sign,
<I>N</I>

replaces the existing value directly.
To assign a negative number either prepend~0 or enclose the negative
number in parentheses.

Besides these standard groff requests, there might be further macro
calls.
They can originate from a macro package (see
<B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?7+roff">roff</A></B>(7)

for an overview) or from a preprocessor.

Preprocessor macros are easy to be recognized.
They enclose their code into a pair of characteristic macros.

<H2>ESCAPE SEQUENCES</H2>


Escape sequences are in-line language elements usually introduced by a
backslash







@m] &quot;@s]R]&quot;









and followed by an escape name and sometimes by a required argument.
Input processing is continued directly after the escaped character or
the argument resp. without an intervening separation character.
So there must be a way to determine the end of the escape name and the
end of the argument.

This is done by enclosing names (escape name and arguments consisting
of a variable name) by a pair of brackets
<B>[lB]</B><I>name</I><B>[rB]</B>

and constant arguments (number expressions and characters) by
apostrophes (ASCII 0x27) like
<B>[cq]</B><I>constant</I><B>[cq]</B><I></I>R].


There are abbreviations for short names.
Two character escape names can be specified by an opening parenthesis
like






without a closing counterpart.
And all one-character names different from the special characters







@m] &quot;@s]R]&quot;









and







@m] &quot;@s]R]&quot;









can even be specified without a marker in the form







Constant arguments of length~1 can omit the marker apostrophes, too,
but there is no two-character analogue.

While 1-character escape sequences are mainly used for in-line
functions and system related tasks, the 2-letter names following the






construct are used for special characters predefined by the roff system.
Escapes sequences with names of more than two characters






denote user defined named characters (see the




<B>ייג=if</B>


request).
