<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The groff mm macros are intended to be compatible with the DWB mm macros
with the following limitations:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>*</B>

<DD>
no Bell Labs localisms implemented.
<DT><B>*</B>

<DD>
the macros OK and PM are not implemented.
<DT><B>*</B>

<DD>
groff mm does not support cut marks
</DL>
<P>

<B>mm</B> is intended to be international.
Therefore it is 
possible to write short national macrofiles which change all
english text to the preferred language.
Use <B>mmse</B> as an example.

<P>

A file called <B>locale</B> or <I>lang</I><B>_locale</B> is read
after the initiation of the global variables.
It is therefore
possible to localize the macros with companyname and so on.
<P>
In this manual square brackets is used to show optional arguments.
<P>
<B>Number registers and strings</B>
<BR>

Many macros can be controlled by number registers and strings.
A number register is assigned with the <B>nr</B> command:
<BR>

<B>.nr</B> <I>XXX</I> <I>[+-]n [i]</I>
<BR>

<B>XXX</B> is the name of the register, <B>n</B> is the value to
be assigned, and <B>i</B> is increment value for auto-increment.
<B>n</B> can have a plus or minus sign as prefix if an increment
or decrement of the current value is wanted.
(Auto-increment or decrement
occurs if the number register is used with a plus or minus sign,
<B>\n+[XXX]</B> or <B>\n-[XXX]</B>.)
<P>
Strings is defined with <B>ds</B>.
<BR>

<B>.ds</B> <I>YYY string</I>
<BR>

The string is assigned everything to the end of the line, even blanks.
Initial blanks in <I>string</I> should be prefixed with
a double-quote.
(Strings are used in the text as <B>\*[YYY]</B>.)
<P>
<B>Special formatting of number registers</B>
<BR>

A number register is printed with normal digits if no format has been
given.
Set the format with <B>af</B>:
<BR>

<B>.af</B> <I>R c</I>
<BR>

<I>R</I> is the name of the register, <I>c</I> is the format.

<BR>

2
<P>

The text will be lined up with the first word of the heading.

<P>
<B>Centered section headings</B>
<BR>

All headings whose level is equal or below number register <B>Hc</B>
and also less than or equal to <B>Hb</B> or <B>Hs</B>
is centerered.
<P>
<B>Font control of the heading</B>
<BR>

The font of each heading level is controlled by string <B>HF</B>.
It contains a fontnumber or fontname for each level.
Default
is <B>2&nbsp;2&nbsp;2&nbsp;2&nbsp;2&nbsp;2&nbsp;2</B> (all headings in italic).
Could also be written as <B>I&nbsp;I&nbsp;I&nbsp;I&nbsp;I&nbsp;I&nbsp;I</B>.
Note that some other implementations use <B>3&nbsp;3&nbsp;2&nbsp;2&nbsp;2&nbsp;2&nbsp;2</B> as the
default value.
All omitted values are presumed to be a 1.
<P>
<B>Point size control</B>.
<BR>

String <B>HP</B> controls the pointsize of each heading, in the
same way as <B>HF</B> controls the font.
A value of 0 selects the default point size.
Default value is <B>0&nbsp;0&nbsp;0&nbsp;0&nbsp;0&nbsp;0&nbsp;0</B>.
Beware that only the
point size changes, not the vertical size.
That can be controlled by the user specified macro <B>HX</B> and/or
<B>HZ</B>.
<P>
<B>Heading counters</B>
<BR>

Seven number registers, named <B>H1</B> thru <B>H7</B> contains
the counter for each heading level.
The values are printed using arabic numerals, this can be changed
with the macro <B>HM</B> (see below).
All marks are concatenated before printing.
To avoid this, set
number register <B>Ht</B> to&nbsp;1.
That will only print the current
heading counter at each heading.
<P>
<B>Automatic table of contents</B>
<BR>

All headings whose level is equal or below number register <B>Cl</B>
is saved to be printed in the table of contents.
Default value is&nbsp;2.
<P>
<B>Special control of the heading, user-defined macros</B>.
<BR>

These macros can be defined by the user to get a finer control
of vertical spacing, fonts or other features.
Argument <I>level</I> is the level-argument to <B>H</B>, but
0 for unnumbered headings (see <B>HU</B>).
Argument <I>rlevel</I> is the real level, it is
set to number register <B>Hu</B> for unnumbered headings.
Argument <I>heading-text</I> is the text argument to <B>H</B> and <B>HU</B>.
<P>
<B>HX&nbsp;</B><I>level&nbsp;rlevel&nbsp;heading-text</I>
<BR>

<B>HX</B> is called just before the printing of the heading.
The following register is available for <B>HX</B>.
<B>HX</B> may alter <B>}0</B>, <B>}2</B> and <B>;3</B>.



<BR>

<B>string }0</B>
<BR>


Contains the heading mark plus two spaces if <I>rlevel</I> is non-zero,
otherwise empty.


<BR>

<B>register ;0</B>
<BR>


Contains the position of the text after the heading.
0 means that the text should follow the heading on the same line, 1
means that a line break should occur before the text and
2 means that a blank line should separate the heading and the text.


<BR>

<B>string }2</B>
<BR>


Contains two spaces if register <B>;0</B> is&nbsp;0.
It is used to
separate the heading from the text.
The string
is empty if <B>;0</B> is non-zero.


<BR>

<B>register ;3</B>
<BR>


Contains the needed space in units after the heading.
Default is 2v.
<P>
Can be used to change things like numbering (<B>}0</B>),
vertical spacing (<B>}2</B>)
and the needed space after the heading.

<P>
<B>HY&nbsp;</B><I>dlevel&nbsp;rlevel&nbsp;heading-text</I>
<BR>

<B>HY</B> is called after size and font calculations and
might be used to change indentation.
<P>
<B>HZ&nbsp;</B><I>dlevel&nbsp;rlevel&nbsp;heading-text</I>
<BR>

<B>HZ</B> is called after the printing of the heading, just before
<B>H</B> or <B>HU</B> exits.
Could be used to change the page header according to the section heading.
<DT><B>HC [hyphenation-character]</B>

<DD>
Set hyphenation character.
Default value is \%.
Resets to the default if called without argument.
Hyphenation can be turned off by setting number
register <B>Hy</B> to 0 in the beginning of the file.

Changes the font to italic if called without arguments.
With one argument it will set the word in italic.
With two argument it will concatenate them and set the first
word in italic and the second in the previous font.
There is no limit on the number of argument, all will be concatenated.
<DT><B>IA [addressee-name [title]]</B>

<DD>
Begins specification of the addressee and addressee's address in
letter style.
Several names can be specified with empty <B>IA</B>/<B>IE</B>-pairs, but
only one address.
See <B>LT</B>.

<DT><B>INITR filename</B>

<DD>
Initialize the refencemacros.
References will be written to stderr and is supposed to
be written to <I>filename.qrf</I>. 
Requires two passes with groff, this is handled by a
separate program called <B>mmroff</B>, the reason is that
groff is often installed without the unsafe operations that
<B>INITR</B> requiered.
The first pass looks for references and the second one includes them.
<B>INITR</B> can be used several times, but it is only the first
occurrence of <B>INITR</B> that is active.
<P>
See also <B>SETR</B>, <B>GETPN</B> and <B>GETHN</B>.
<DT><B>IND arg1 [arg2 [...]]</B>

<DD>

<DT><B>INDP</B>

<DD>
<B>INDP</B> prints the index by running the command specified
by string variable <B>Indcmd</B>, normally <I>sort&nbsp;-t\t</I>.
<B>INDP</B> reads the output from the command to form
the index, normally in two columns (can be changed by defining <B>TYIND</B>).
The index is printed with string variable <B>Index</B> as header,
default is <B>INDEX</B>.
One-column processing is
returned after the list.
<B>INDP</B> will call the
user-defined macros <B>TXIND</B>, <B>TYIND</B> and <B>TZIND</B> if defined.
<B>TXIND</B> is called before printing <B>INDEX</B>, <B>TYIND</B>
is called instead of printing <B>INDEX</B>.
<B>TZIND</B> is called
after the printing and should take care of restoring to normal
operation again.
<DT><B>ISODATE [0]</B>

<DD>
<B>ISODATE</B> changes the predefined date string in <B>DT</B> to
ISO-format, ie YYYY-MM-DD.
This can also be done by
adding <B>-rIso=1</B> on the command line.
Reverts to old date format if argument is <B>0</B>.
<DT><B>IR [italic-text [roman-text [italic-text [...]]]]</B>

<DD>
Italic-roman.
Even arguments is printed in italic, odd in roman.
See <B>I</B>.
<DT><B>LB text-indent mark-indent pad type [mark [LI-space [LB-space]]]</B>

<DD>
List begin macro.
This is the common macro used for all lists.
<I>Text-indent</I> is the number of spaces to indent the text from the
current indent.
<P>
<I>Pad</I> and <I>mark-indent</I> controls where to put the mark.
The mark is placed within the mark area, and <I>mark-indent</I>
sets the number of spaces before this area.
It is normally&nbsp;0.
The mark area ends where the text begins.
The start of the text
is still controlled by <I>text-indent</I>.
<P>
The mark is left justified whitin the mark area if <I>pad</I> is 0.
If <I>pad</I> is greater than 0, then <I>mark-indent</I> is ignored, and
the mark is placed <I>pad</I> spaces before the text.
This will right justify the mark.
<P>
If <I>type</I> is 0 the list will have either a hanging indent or, if
argument <I>mark</I> is given, the string <I>mark</I> as mark.
<P>
If <I>type</I> is greater than 0 automatic numbering will occur, arabic
if <I>mark</I> is empty.
<I>Mark</I> can then be any of <B>1</B>, <B>A</B>,
<B>a</B>, <B>I</B> or <B>i</B>.
<P>
<I>Type</I> selects one of six possible ways to display the mark.

Default is&nbsp;1.
<P>
<B>LB</B> itself will print <I>LB-space</I> blank lines.
Default is&nbsp;0.
<DT><B>LC [list-level]</B>

<DD>
List-status clear.
Terminates all current active lists down to <I>list-level</I>, or 0
if no argmuent is given.
This is used by <B>H</B> to clear any
active list.
<DT><B>LE [1]</B>

<DD>
List end.
Terminate the current list.
<B>LE</B> outputs a blank line
if an argument is given.
<DT><B>LI [mark [1]]</B>

<DD>
List item precedes every item in a list.
Without argument <B>LI</B>
will print the mark determined by the current list type.
By giving
<B>LI</B> one argument, it will use that as the mark instead.
Two arguments to <B>LI</B> will make <I>mark</I> a prefix to
the current mark.
There will be no separating space between the prefix
and the mark if the second argument is <B>2</B> instead of <B>1</B>.
This behaviour can also be achieved by setting number register
<B>Limsp</B> to zero.
A zero length <I>mark</I> will make a hanging
indent instead.
<P>
A blank line is normally printed before the list item.
This behaviour
can be controlled by number register <B>Ls</B>.
Pre-spacing
will occur for each list-level less than or equal to <B>Ls</B>.
Default value is&nbsp;99.
(Nesting of lists is unlimited.&nbsp;:-)
<P>
The indentation can be changed thru number register <B>Li</B>.
Default is 6.
<P>
All lists begins with a list initialization macro, <B>LB</B>.
There are, however, seven predefined listtypes to
make lists easier to use.
They all call <B>LB</B> with different
default values.

<DT><B>MC column-size [column-separation] </B>

<DD>
Begin multiple columns.
Return to normal with <B>1C</B>.
<B>MC</B> will create as many columns as the current line length permits.
<I>Column-size</I> is the width of each column, and <I>column-separation</I>

Move to a position, pageoffset set to <I>x-pos</I>.
If <I>line-length</I> is not given, the difference between
current and new pageoffset is used.
Use <B>PGFORM</B> without arguments to return to normal.
<DT><B>MULB cw1 space1 [cw2 space2 [cw3 ...]]</B>

<DD>
Begin a special multi-column mode.
Every columns width must be specified.
Also the space between the columns must be specified.
The last column
does not need any space-definition.
<B>MULB</B> starts a diversion and <B>MULE</B>
ends the diversion and prints the columns.
The unit for width and space is 'n', but <B>MULB</B> accepts all 
normal unitspecifications like 'c' and 'i'.
<B>MULB</B> operates in a separate environment.
<DT><B>MULN</B>

<DD>
Begin the next column.
This is the only way to switch column.
<DT><B>MULE</B>

<DD>
End the multi-column mode and print the columns.
<DT><B>nP [type]</B>

<DD>
Print numbered paragraph with header level two.
See <B>.P</B>.
<DT><B>NCOL</B>

the <B>MUL*</B> macros, see <B>2C</B>.
<DT><B>NS [arg [1]]</B>

<DD>
Prints different types of notations.
The argument selects between
the predefined type of notations.
If the second argument is available, 
then the argument becomes the entire notation.
If the argument doesn't exist in the predefined, it will be
printed as <B>Copy (</B><I>arg</I><B>) to</B>.

See <B>EF</B> and <B>PF</B>.
<DT><B>OH [arg]</B>

<DD>
Odd-page header, a line printed just below the normal header.
See <B>EH</B> and <B>PH</B>.
<DT><B>OP</B>

<DD>
Make sure that the following text is printed at the top
of an odd-numbered page.
Will not output an empty page
if currently at the top of an odd page.
<DT><B>P [type]</B>

<DD>
Begin new paragraph.
<B>P</B> without argument will produce left justified text, even
the first line of the paragraph.
This is the same as setting
<I>type</I> to 0.
If the argument is&nbsp;1, then the first line
of text following <B>P</B> will be indented by the number of
spaces in number register <B>Pi</B>, normally 5.
<P>
Instead of giving 1 as argument to <B>P</B> it is possible to set the
paragraph type in number register <B>Pt</B>.
Using 0 and&nbsp;1
will be the same as adding that value to <B>P</B>.
A value of 2 will indent all paragraphs, except after
headings, lists and displays.
<P>
The space between two paragraphs is controlled by number register <B>Ps</B>,
and is 1 by default (one blank line).
<DT><B>PGFORM [linelength [pagelength [pageoffset [1]]]]</B>

<DD>
Sets linelength, pagelength and/or pageoffset.
This macro can be used for special formatting, like letterheads
and other.
It is normally the first command in a file, though it's not necessary.
<B>PGFORM</B> can be used without arguments 
to reset everything after a <B>MOVE</B>.
A line-break is done unless the fourth argument is given.
This can be used to avoid the pagenumber on the first page while setting
new width and length.
(It seems as if this macro sometimes doesn't work too well.
Use the command line arguments
to change linelength, pagelength and pageoffset instead.
Sorry.)
<DT><B>PGNH</B>

<DD>
No header is printed on the next page.
Used to get rid of
the header in letters or other special texts.
This macro must be used before any text to inhibit the pageheader
on the first page.
<DT><B>PIC [-L] [-C] [-R] [-I n] filename [width [height]]</B>

<DD>
<B>PIC</B> includes a Postscript file in the document.
The macro depends on <B>mmroff</B> and <B>INITR</B>.
<B>-L</B>, <B>-C</B>, <B>-R</B> and <B>-I n</B> adjusts the picture
or indents it.
The optionally <I>width</I> and <I>height</I>
can also be given to resize the picture.

The argument should be specified as &quot;'left-part'center-part'right-part'&quot;,
where left-, center- and right-part is printed left-justified, centered
and right justified.
The character <B>%</B> is changed to the current
page number.
The default page-header is &quot;''- % -''&quot;, the page
number between two dashes.
<DT><B>PS</B>

<DD>
Picture start (from pic).
Begins a picture for <B>pic</B>, see
the manual.
<DT><B>PX</B>

See <B>I</B>.
<DT><B>RD [prompt [diversion [string]]]</B>

<DD>
Read from standard input to diversion and/or string.
The text will be saved in a diversion named <I>diversion</I>.
Recall the text by writing the name of the diversion after a dot
on an empty line.
A string will also be defined if
<I>string</I> is given.
<I>Diversion</I> and/or <I>prompt</I> can 
be empty (&quot;&quot;).
<DT><B>RF</B>

incremented number between
square brackets.
<I>Text-indent</I> changes the default indentation.
<DT><B>RP [arg1 [arg2]]</B>

<DD>
Produce reference page.
<B>RP</B> can be used if a reference page is wanted somewhere in the
document.
It is not needed if <B>TC</B> is used to produce

The reference items will be separated by a blank line.
Setting number register <B>Ls</B> to 0 will suppress the line.
<P>
The string <B>Rp</B> contains the reference page title and
is normally set to <I>REFERENCES</I>.
<DT><B>RS [string-name]</B>

<DD>
<B>RS</B> begins an automatically numbered reference definition.
Put the string <B>\*(Rf</B> where the reference mark
should be and write the reference between <B>RS</B>/<B>RF</B>
at next new line after the reference mark.
The reference number
is stored in number register <B>:R</B>.
If <I>string-name</I> is given, a string with that name
will be defined and contain the current reference mark.
The string can be referenced as <B>\*[</B><I>string-name</I>] later in
the text.
<DT><B>S [size [spacing]]</B>

<DD>
Set point size and vertical spacing.
If any argument is equal 'P', then
the previous value is used.

If '+' or '-' is used before the value, then increment or decrement of
the current value will be done.
<DT><B>SA [arg]</B>

<DD>
Set right-margin justification.
Justification is normally turned on.
No argumenent or <B>0</B> turns off justification, a <B>1</B> turns on
justification.

<DT><B>SG [arg [1]]</B>

<DD>
Signature line.
Prints the authors name(s) after the formal closing.
The argument will be appended to the reference data, printed
at either the first or last author.
The reference data is the location,
department and initials specified with <B>.AU</B>.
It will be printed at the first author if the second argument is given,
otherwise at the last.
No reference data will be printed if the author(s) is specifed
thru <B>.WA</B>/<B>.WE</B>.
See <B>INTERNALS</B>.
<DT><B>SK [pages]</B>

<DD>

If <I>pages</I> is <B>0</B> or omitted, a skip to the next page
will occur unless it is already at the top of a page.
Otherwise it will skip <I>pages</I> pages.
<DT><B>SM string1 [string2 [string3]]</B>

<DD>
Make a string smaller.
If <I>string2</I> is given, <I>string1</I> will be smaller and <I>string2</I>
normal, concatenated with <I>string1</I>.

concatenated, but only <I>string2</I> is made smaller.
<DT><B>SP [lines]</B>

<DD>
Space vertically.
<I>lines</I> can have any scalingfactor, like <I>3i</I> or
<I>8v</I>.
Several <B>SP</B> in a line will only produce the
maximum number of lines, not the sum.
<B>SP</B> will also be ignored
until the first textline in a page.
Add a <B>\&amp;</B> before <B>SP</B>
to avoid this.
<DT><B>TAB</B>

<DD>
reset tabs to every&nbsp;5n.
Normally used to reset any previous tabpositions.
<DT><B>TB [title [override [flag [refname]]]]</B>

<DD>
Table title, arguments are the same as for <B>EC</B>.
<B>TB</B> uses the number register <B>Tb</B> as counter.
The string <B>Lt</B> controls the title of the
List of Tables, default is <I>LIST OF TABLES</I>.
The List of Tables will only be printed if number register <B>Lt</B>
is 1, default 1.
The string <B>Litb</B> contains the word <I>TABLE</I>, wich
is printed before the number.
<BR>

Special handling of the title will occur if
<B>TB</B> is used inside <B>DS</B>/<B>DE</B>, it will not be
affected by the format of <B>DS</B>.
<DT><B>TC [slevel [spacing [tlevel [tab [h1 [h2 [h3 [h4 [h5]]]]]]]]]</B>

<DD>
Table of contents.
This macro is normally used at the last line of the document.
It generates a table of contents with headings up to the level
controlled by number register <B>Cl</B>.
Note that <B>Cl</B> controls
the saving of headings, it has nothing to do with <B>TC</B>.
Headings with level less than or equal to <I>slevel</I> will get
<I>spacing</I> number of lines before them.
Headings with level less than or equal to <I>tlevel</I> will have
their page numbers right justified with dots or spaces separating
the text and the page number.
Spaces is used if <I>tab</I>
is greater than zero, otherwise dots.
Other headings will have the
page number directly at the end of the heading text (<I>ragged right</I>).
<P>
The rest of the arguments will be printed, centered, before the
table of contents.
<P>
The user-defined macros <B>TX</B> and <B>TY</B> are used if <B>TC</B> is called
with at most four arguments.
<B>TX</B> is called before the printing
of <I>CONTENTS</I>, and <B>TY</B> is called instead of printing <I>CONTENTS</I>.
<P>
Equivalent macros can be defined for list of figures, tables, equations
and excibits by defining <B>TXxx</B> or <B>TYxx</B>, where <B>xx</B>
is <B>Fg</B>, <B>TB</B>, <B>EC</B> or <B>EX</B>.
<P>
String <B>Ci</B> can be set to control the indentations for each heading-level.
It must be scaled, like <B>.ds&nbsp;Ci&nbsp;.25i&nbsp;.5i&nbsp;.75i&nbsp;1i&nbsp;1i</B>.
The indentation is normally controlled by the maxlength of headings
in each level.
<P>
All texts can be redefined, new stringvariables 
<I>Lifg</I>, <I>Litb</I>, <I>Liex</I>, <I>Liec</I> and <I>Licon</I> contain
&quot;Figure&quot;, &quot;TABLE&quot;, &quot;Exhibit&quot;, &quot;Equation&quot; and &quot;CONTENTS&quot;.
These can be redefined to other languages.

The letter macros is using different submacros depending on
the letter type.
The name of the submacro has the letter type
as suffix.
It is therefore possible to define other letter types, either
in the national macro-file, or as local additions.
<B>.LT</B> will set the number variables <B>Pt</B> and <B>Pi</B> to 0 and 5.
The following strings and macros must be defined for a new letter type:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B><A HREF="mailto:let@init_">let@init_</A></B><I>type</I><DD>
This macro is called directly by <B>.LT</B>.
It is supposed to initialize
variables and other stuff.
<DT><B><A HREF="mailto:let@head_">let@head_</A></B><I>type</I><DD>
This macro prints the letter head, and is called instead of the
normal page header.
It is supposed to remove the alias <B><A HREF="mailto:let@header">let@header</A></B>,
otherwise it will be called for all pages.
<DT><B>let@sg_</B><I>type&nbsp;name&nbsp;title&nbsp;n&nbsp;flag&nbsp;[arg1&nbsp;[arg2&nbsp;[...]]]</I><DD>
<B>.SG</B> is calling this macro only for letters, memorandums has
its own processing.
<I>name</I> and <I>title</I> is specified
thru <B>.WA</B>/<B>.WB</B>.
<I>n</I> is the counter, 1-max, and
<I>flag</I> is true for the last name.
Any other argument to <B>.SG</B>
is appended.
<DT><B>let@fc_</B><I>type&nbsp;closing</I><DD>
This macro is called by <B>.FC</B>, and has the
formal closing as argument.
</DL>
<P>

<B>.LO</B> is implemented as a general option-macro.
<B>.LO</B> demands
that a string named <B>Let</B><I>type</I> is defined, where <I>type</I>
is the letter type.
<B>.LO</B> will then assign the argument to the string
variable <B>let*lo-</B><I>type</I>.
