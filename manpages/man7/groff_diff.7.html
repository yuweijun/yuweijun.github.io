groff_diff - differences between GNU troff and classical troff

<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>


This manual page describes the language differences between
<I>groff</I>,

the GNU
<I>roff</I>

text processing system and the classical
<I>roff</I>

formatter of the freely available Unix~7 of the 1970s, documented in
the
<I>Troff User's Manual</I>

by
<I>Osanna</I>

and
<I>Kernighan</I>.

This inludes the roff language as well as the intermediate output
format (troff output).

The section
<I>SEE ALSO</I>

gives pointers to both the classical
<I>roff</I>

and the modern
<I>groff</I>

documentation.

At the moment, this document is the place of the most actual
documentation within the
<I>groff</I>

system.
This might change in the future.
Actually, all novelties of the groff language are first described here
and will pervade into the other documents only at a later stage.

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>GROFF LANGUAGE</H2>


In this section, all additional features of
<I>groff</I>

compared to the classical Unix~7
<I>troff</I>

are described in detail.

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Long names</H3>


The names of number registers, fonts, strings/:macros/:diversions,
special characters, and colors can be of any length.
In escape sequences, additionally to the classical
<B>(</B><I>xx</I>

construction for a two character name, you can use
<B>[</B><I>xxx</I><B>]</B>

for a name of arbitrary length, for example in
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>[rs][</B><I>xxx</I><B>]</B>

<DD>
Print the special character called
<I>xxx</I>.

<DT><B>[rs]f[</B><I>xxx</I><B>]</B>

<DD>
Set font
<I>xxx</I>.

Additionally,
<B>[rs]f[]</B>

is a new syntax equal to
<B>[rs]fP</B>,

i.e., to return to the previous font.
<DT><B>[rs]*[</B><I>xxx arg1 arg2 ...</I><B>]</B>

<DD>
Interpolate string
<I>xxx</I>,

taking
<I>arg1</I>,

<I>arg2</I>,

<I>...</I>

as arguments.
<DT><B>[rs]n[</B><I>xxx</I><B>]</B>

<DD>
Interpolate number register
<I>xxx</I>.


</DL>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Fractional pointsizes</H3>


A
<I>scaled point</I>

is equal to
<B>1/sizescale</B>

points, where
<B>sizescale</B>

is specified in the
<B>DESC</B>

file (1 by default).
There is a new scale indicator
<B>z</B>

that has the effect of multiplying by sizescale.
Requests and escape sequences in troff interpret arguments that
represent a pointsize as being in units of scaled points, but they
evaluate each such argument using a default scale indicator of
<B>z</B>.

Arguments treated in this way are the argument to the
<B>ps</B>

request, the third argument to the
<B>cs</B>

request, the second and fourth arguments to the
<B>tkf</B>

request, the argument to the
<B>[rs]H</B>

escape sequence, and those variants of the
<B>[rs]s</B>

escape sequence that take a numeric expression as their argument.

For example, suppose sizescale is 1000; then a scaled point will be
equivalent to a millipoint; the call
<B>.ps&nbsp;10.25</B>

is equivalent to
<B>.ps&nbsp;10.25z</B>

and so sets the pointsize to 10250 scaled points, which is equal to
10.25 points.

The number register
<B>[rs]n[.s]</B>

returns the pointsize in points as decimal fraction.
There is also a new number register
<B>[rs]n[.ps]</B>

that returns the pointsize in scaled points.

It would make no sense to use the
<B>z</B>

scale indicator in a numeric expression whose default scale indicator
was neither
<B>u</B>

nor
<B>z</B>,

and so
<B>troff</B>

disallows this.
Similarly it would make no sense to use a scaling indicator other than
<B>z</B>

or
<B>u</B>

in a numeric expression whose default scale indicator was
<B>z</B>,

and so
<B>troff</B>

disallows this as well.

There is also new scale indicator~<B>s</B>

which multiplies by the number of units in a scaled point.
So, for example,
<B>[rs]n[.ps]s</B>

is equal to
<B>1m</B>.

Be sure not to confuse the
<B>s</B>

and
<B>z</B>

scale indicators.

<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Numeric expressions</H3>


Spaces are permitted in a number expression within parentheses.

<B>M</B>

indicates a scale of 100ths of an em.
<B>f</B>

indicates a scale of 65536 units, providing fractions for color
definitions with the
<B>defcolor</B>

request.
For example, 0.5f = 32768u.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>e1</I><B>&gt;?</B><I>e2</I>

<DD>
The maximum of
<I>e1</I>

and
<I>e2</I>.

<DT><I>e1</I><B>&lt;?</B><I>e2</I>

<DD>
The minimum of
<I>e1</I>

and
<I>e2</I>.

<DT><B>(</B><I>c</I><B>;</B><I>e</I><B>)</B>

<DD>
Evaluate
<I>e</I>

using
<I>c</I>

as the default scaling indicator.
If
<I>c</I>

is missing, ignore scaling indicators in the evaluation of
<I>e</I>.

<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>New escape sequences</H3>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>[rs]A'</B><I>anything</I><B>'</B>

<DD>
This expands to
<B>1</B>

or
<B>0</B>

resp., depending on whether
<I>anything</I>

is or is not acceptable as the name of a string, macro, diversion, number
register, environment, font, or color.
It will return~<B>0</B>

if
<I>anything</I>

is empty.
This is useful if you want to lookup user input in some sort of
associative table.
<DT><B>[rs]B'</B><I>anything</I><B>'</B>

<DD>
This expands to
<B>1</B>

or
<B>0</B>

resp., depending on whether
<I>anything</I>

is or is not a valid numeric expression.
It will return~<B>0</B>

if
<I>anything</I>

is empty.
<DT><B>[rs]C'</B><I>xxx</I><B>'</B>

<DD>
Typeset character named
<I>xxx</I>.

Normally it is more convenient to use
<B>[rs][</B><I>xxx</I><B>]</B>R].

But
<B>[rs]C</B>

has the advantage that it is compatible with recent versions of
<FONT SIZE="-1">UNIX</FONT>
and is available in compatibility mode.
<DT><B>[rs]E</B>

<DD>
This is equivalent to an escape character, but it is not interpreted in
copy-mode.
For example, strings to start and end superscripting could be defined
like this
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>


ייג=if


<BR>


ייג=if




The use of
<B>[rs]E</B>

ensures that these definitions will work even if
<B>[rs]*{</B>

gets interpreted in copy-mode (for example, by being used in a macro
argument).
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><B>[rs]F</B><I>f</I>

<BR>


<DT>

<B>[rs]F(</B><I>fm</I>


<DD>

<DT>

<B>[rs]F[</B><I>fam</I><B>]</B>

<DD>Change font family.
This is the same as the
<B>fam</B>

request.
<B>[rs]F[]</B>

switches back to the previous color (note that
<B>[rs]FP</B>

won't work; it selects font family `P' instead).
<DT><B>[rs]m</B><I>x</I>

<DD>

<BR>


<DT>

<B>[rs]m(</B><I>xx</I>


<DD>

<DT>

<B>[rs]m[</B><I>xxx</I><B>]</B>

<DD>Set drawing color.
<B>[rs]m[]</B>

switches back to the previous color.
<DT><B>[rs]M</B><I>x</I>

<DD>

<BR>


<DT>

<B>[rs]M(</B><I>xx</I>


<DD>

<DT>

<B>[rs]M[</B><I>xxx</I><B>]</B>

<DD>Set background color for filled objects drawn with the
<B>[rs]D'</B><I>...</I><B>'</B>

commands.
<B>[rs]M[]</B>

switches back to the previous color.
<DT><B>[rs]N'</B><I>n</I><B>'</B>

<DD>
Typeset the character with code
<I>n</I>

in the current font.
<I>n</I>

can be any integer.
Most devices only have characters with codes between 0 and 255.
If the current font does not contain a character with that code,
special fonts will
<I>not</I>

be searched.
The
<B>[rs]N</B>

escape sequence can be conveniently used in conjunction with the
<B>char</B>

request, for example
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>

ייג=if



</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
The code of each character is given in the fourth column in the font
description file after the
<B>charset</B>

command.
It is possible to include unnamed characters in the font description
file by using a name of
<B>---</B>;

the
<B>[rs]N</B>

escape sequence is the only way to use these.
<DT><B>[rs]O</B><I>n</I>

<DD>

<BR>


<DT>

<B>[rs]O[</B><I>n</I><B>]</B>

<DD>Suppressing troff output.
The escapes
<B>[rs]02</B>,

<B>[rs]O3</B>,

<B>[rs]O4</B>,

and
<B>[rs]O5</B>

are intended for internal use by
<B>grohtml</B>.

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>[rs]O0</B>

<DD>
Disable any ditroff glyphs from being emitted to the device driver,
provided that the escape occurs at the outer level (see
<B>[rs]O3</B>

and
<B>[rs]O4</B>).

<DT><B>[rs]O1</B>

<DD>
Enable output of glyphs, provided that the escape occurs at the outer
level.
<DT><DD>
<B>[rs]O0</B>

and
<B>[rs]O1</B>

also reset the registers
<B>[rs]n[opminx]</B>,

<B>[rs]n[opminy]</B>,

<B>[rs]n[opmaxx]</B>,

and
<B>[rs]n[opmaxy]</B>

to~-1.
These four registers mark the top left and bottom right hand corners
of a box which encompasses all written glyphs.
<DT><B>[rs]O2</B>

<DD>
Provided that the escape occurs at the outer level, enable output of
glyphs and also write out to stderr the page number and four registers
encompassing the glyphs previously written since the last call to
<B>[rs]O</B>.

<DT><B>[rs]O3</B>

<DD>
Begin a nesting level.
At start-up,
<B>troff</B>

is at outer level.
This is really an internal mechanism for
<B>grohtml</B>

while producing images.
They are generated by running the troff source through
<B>troff</B>

to the postscript device and
<B>ghostscript</B>

to produce images in PNG format.
The
<B>[rs]O3</B>

escape will start a new page if the device is not html (to reduce the
possibility of images crossing a page boundary).
<DT><B>[rs]O4</B>

<DD>
End a nesting level.
<DT><B>[rs]O5[</B><I>Pfilename</I><B>]</B>

<DD>
This escape is
<B>grohtml</B>

specific.
Provided that this escape occurs at the outer nesting level, write
<I>filename</I>

to stderr.
The position of the image,
<I>P</I>,

must be specified and must be one of l, r, c, or i (left, right,
centered, inline).
<I>filename</I>

will be associated with the production of the next inline image.
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><B>[rs]R'</B><I>name&nbsp;[+-]n</I><B>'</B>

<DD>
This has the same effect as
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

</DL>
</DL>

<DT><B>[rs]s(</B><I>nn</I>

<BR>


<DT>

<B>[rs]s[+-](</B><I>nn</I>

<DD>Set the point size to

points;
<I>nn</I>

must be exactly two digits.
<DT><B>[rs]s[[+-]</B><I>n</I><B>]</B>

<DD>

<B>[rs]s'[+-]</B><I>n</I><B>'</B>


<DD>

<DT>

<B>[rs]s[+-]'</B><I>n</I><B>'</B>

<DD>Set the point size to
<I>n</I>

scaled points;
<I>n</I>

is a numeric expression with a default scale indicator of~<B>z</B>.

<DT><B>[rs]V</B><I>x</I>

<BR>


<DT>

<B>[rs]V(</B><I>xx</I>


<DD>

<DT>

<B>[rs]V[</B><I>xxx</I><B>]</B>

<DD>Interpolate the contents of the environment variable
<I>xxx</I>,

as returned by
<B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?3+getenv">getenv</A></B>(3).

<B>[rs]V</B>

is interpreted in copy-mode.
<DT><B>[rs]Y</B><I>x</I>

<DD>

<BR>


<DT>

<B>[rs]Y(</B><I>xx</I>


<DD>

<DT>

<B>[rs]Y[</B><I>xxx</I><B>]</B>

<DD>This is approximately equivalent to
<B>[rs]X'[rs]*[</B><I>xxx</I><B>]'</B>R].

However the contents of the string or macro
<I>xxx</I>

are not interpreted; also it is permitted for
<I>xxx</I>

to have been defined as a macro and thus contain newlines (it is not
permitted for the argument to
<B>[rs]X</B>

to contain newlines).
The inclusion of newlines requires an extension to the UNIX troff
output format, and will confuse drivers that do not know about this
extension.
<DT><B>[rs]Z'</B><I>anything</I><B>'</B>

<DD>
Print anything and then restore the horizontal and vertical position;
<I>anything</I>

may not contain tabs or leaders.
<DT><B>[rs]$0</B>

<DD>
The name by which the current macro was invoked.
The
<B>als</B>

request can make a macro have more than one name.
<DT><B>[rs]$*</B>

<DD>
In a macro or string, the concatenation of all the arguments separated
by spaces.
<DT><B>[rs]$@</B>

<DD>
In a macro or string, the concatenation of all the arguments with each
surrounded by double quotes, and separated by spaces.
<DT><B>[rs]$(</B><I>nn</I>

<DD>

<BR>


<DT>

<B>[rs]$[</B><I>nnn</I><B>]</B>

<DD>In a macro or string, this gives the
<I>nn</I>-th

or
<I>nnn</I>-th

argument.
Macros and strings can have an unlimited number of arguments.
<DT><B>[rs]?</B><I>anything</I><B>[rs]?</B>

<DD>
When used in a diversion, this will transparently embed
<I>anything</I>

in the diversion.
<I>anything</I>

is read in copy mode.
When the diversion is reread,
<I>anything</I>

will be interpreted.
<I>anything</I>

may not contain newlines; use
<B>[rs]!</B>

if you want to embed newlines in a diversion.
The escape sequence
<B>[rs]?</B>

is also recognised in copy mode and turned into a single internal
code; it is this code that terminates
<I>anything</I>.

This increases the width of the preceding character so that the
spacing between that character and the following character will be
correct if the following character is a roman character.

It is a good idea to use this escape sequence whenever an italic
character is immediately followed by a roman character without any
intervening space.
<DT><B>[rs],</B>

<DD>
This modifies the spacing of the following character so that the
spacing between that character and the preceding character will
correct if the preceding character is a roman character.

It is a good idea to use this escape sequence whenever a roman
character is immediately followed by an italic character without any
intervening space.

<DD>
This produces an unbreakable space that stretches like a normal

This causes the insertion of a zero-width break point.
It is equal to

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>.aln&nbsp;</B><I>xx&nbsp;yy</I>

<I>yy</I>.

The new name and the old name will be exactly equivalent.
If
<I>yy</I>

<DT><B>.als&nbsp;</B><I>xx&nbsp;yy</I>

<DD>
Create an alias

The new name and the old name will be exactly equivalent (it is

but compatibility mode is switched off during execution.
To be more precise, a `compatibility save' token is inserted at the

the end.
As a consequence, the requests
<B>am</B>,

<B>am1</B>,

<B>de</B>,

<B>de1</B>

can be intermixed freely since the compatibility save/:restore tokens
only affect the macro parts defined by

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1<DD>
The character ends sentences (initially characters
<B>.?!</B>

have this property).
<DT>2<DD>
Lines can be broken before the character (initially no characters have
this property); a line will not be broken at a character with this
property unless the characters on each side both have non-zero
hyphenation codes.
<DT>4<DD>
Lines can be broken after the character (initially characters
<B>-[rs](hy[rs](em</B>

have this property); a line will not be broken at a character with
this property unless the characters on each side both have non-zero
hyphenation codes.
<DT>8<DD>
The character overlaps horizontally (initially characters
<B>[rs](ul[rs](rn[rs](ru</B>

have this property).
<DT>16<DD>
The character overlaps vertically (initially character
<B>[rs](br</B>

has this property).
<DT>32<DD>
An end-of-sentence character followed by any number of characters with
this property will be treated as the end of a sentence if followed by
a newline or two spaces; in other words the character is transparent
for the purposes of end-of-sentence recognition; this is the same as
having a zero space factor in tx] (initially characters

set to
<B>[rs]</B>

while
<I>string</I>

is being processed.
Any emboldening, constant spacing or track kerning will be applied to
this object rather than to individual characters in
<I>string</I>.

<DT><DD>
A character defined by this request can be used just like a normal
character provided by the output device.
In particular other characters can be translated to it with the
<B>tr</B>

request; it can be made the leader character by the
<B>lc</B>

request; repeated patterns can be drawn with the character using the
<B>[rs]l</B>

and
<B>[rs]L</B>

escape sequences; words containing the character can be hyphenated
correctly, if the
<B>hcode</B>

request is used to give the character a hyphenation code.
<DT><DD>
There is a special anti-recursion feature: use of character within the
character's definition will be handled like normal characters not
defined with
<B>char</B>.

<DT><DD>
A character definition can be removed with the
<B>rchar</B>

request.
<DT><B>.chop&nbsp;</B><I>xx</I>

<DD>
Chop the last character off macro, string, or diversion
<I>xx</I>.

This is useful for removing the newline from the end of diversions
that are to be interpolated as strings.
<DT><B>.close&nbsp;</B><I>stream</I>

<DD>
Close the stream named
<I>stream</I>;

<I>stream</I>

will no longer be an acceptable argument to the
<B>write</B>

request.
See the
<B>open</B>

request.
<DT><B>.continue</B>

<DD>
Finish the current iteration of a while loop.
See also the
<B>while</B>

and
<B>break</B>

requests.
<DT><B>.color&nbsp;</B><I>n</I>

<DD>
If
<I>n</I>

is non-zero or missing, enable colors (this is the default), otherwise
disable them.
<DT><B>.cp&nbsp;</B><I>n</I>

<DD>
If
<I>n</I>

is non-zero or missing, enable compatibility mode, otherwise disable
it.
In compatibility mode, long names are not recognised, and the
incompatibilities caused by long names do not arise.
<DT><B>.defcolor&nbsp;</B><I>xxx&nbsp;scheme&nbsp;color_components</I>

<DD>
Define color.
<I>scheme</I>

can be one of the following values:
<B>rgb</B>

(three components),
<B>cym</B>

(three components),
<B>cmyk</B>

(four components), and
<B>gray</B>

or
<B>grey</B>

(one component).
Color components can be given either as a hexadecimal string or as
positive decimal integers in the range 0-65535.
A hexadecimal string contains all color components concatenated; it
must start with either
<B>#</B>

or
<B>##</B>.

The former specifies hex values in the range 0-255 (which are
internally multiplied by~257), the latter in the range 0-65535.
Examples: #FFC0CB (pink), ##ffff0000ffff (magenta).
A new scaling indicator~<B>f</B>

has been introduced which multiplies its value by~65536; this makes
it convenient to specify color components as fractions in the range 0
to~1.
Example:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>


ייג=if


<BR>


</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
Note that
<B>f</B>

is the default scaling indicator for the
<B>defcolor</B>

request, thus the above statement is equivalent to
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>


ייג=if


<BR>


</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
The color named
<B>default</B>

(which is device-specific) can't be redefined.
It is possible that the default color for





ייג=if




and





ייג=if




is not the same.
<DT><B>.dei&nbsp;</B><I>xx&nbsp;yy</I>

<DD>
Define macro indirectly.
The following example
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>


<PRE>

ייג=if

ייג=if

ייג=if
</PRE>


</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
is equivalent to
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>


ייג=if


<BR>


</DL>
</DL>

<DT><B>.de1&nbsp;</B><I>xx&nbsp;yy</I>

<DD>
Similar to
<B>.de</B>,

but compatibility mode is switched off during execution.
On entry, the current compatibility mode is saved and restored at exit.
<DT><B>.do&nbsp;</B><I>xxx</I>

<DD>
Interpret
<I>.xxx</I>

with compatibility mode disabled.
For example,
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>


ייג=if


<BR>



would have the same effect as
<DT><DD>


ייג=if


<BR>



except that it would work even if compatibility mode had been enabled.
Note that the previous compatibility mode is restored before any files
sourced by
<I>xxx</I>

are interpreted.
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><B>.ds1&nbsp;</B><I>xx&nbsp;yy</I>

<DD>
Similar to
<B>.ds</B>,

but compatibility mode is switched off during expansion.
To be more precise, a `compatibility save' token is inserted at the
beginning of the string, and a `compatibility restore' token at the end.
<DT><B>.ecs</B>

<DD>
Save current escape character.
<DT><B>.ecr</B>

<DD>
Restore escape character saved with
<B>ecs</B>.

Without a previous call to
<B>ecs</B>,

`<B>[rs]</B>'

will be the new escape character.
<DT><B>.evc&nbsp;</B><I>xx</I>

<DD>
Copy the contents of environment
<I>xx</I>

to the current environment.
No pushing or popping of environments will be done.
<DT><B>.fam&nbsp;</B><I>xx</I>

<DD>
Set the current font family to
<I>xx</I>.

The current font family is part of the current environment.
If
<I>xx</I>

is missing, switch back to previous font family.
The value at start-up is `T'.
See the description of the
<B>sty</B>

request for more information on font families.
<DT><B>.fchar&nbsp;</B><I>c&nbsp;string</I>

<DD>
Define fallback character
<I>c</I>

to be
<I>string</I>.

The syntax of this request is the same as the
<B>char</B>

request; the only difference is that a character defined with
<B>char</B>

hides the glyph with the same name in the current font, whereas a
character defined with
<B>fchar</B>

is checked only if the particular glyph isn't found in the current font.
This test happens before checking special fonts.
<DT><B>.fspecial&nbsp;</B><I>f&nbsp;s1&nbsp;s2...</I>

<DD>
When the current font is
<I>f</I>,

fonts
<I>s1</I>,

<I>s2</I>,...

will be special, that is, they will searched for characters not in
the current font.
Any fonts specified in the
<B>special</B>

request will be searched after fonts specified in the
<B>fspecial</B>

request.
<DT><B>.ftr&nbsp;</B><I>f&nbsp;g</I>

<DD>
Translate font
<I>f</I>

to
<I>g</I>.

Whenever a font named
<I>f</I>

is referred to in an
<B>[rs]f</B>

escape sequence, or in the
<B>ft</B>,

<B>ul</B>,

<B>bd</B>,

<B>cs</B>,

<B>tkf</B>,

<B>special</B>,

<B>fspecial</B>,

<B>fp</B>,

or
<B>sty</B>

requests, font
<I>g</I>

will be used.
If
<I>g</I>

is missing, or equal to
<I>f</I>

then font
<I>f</I>

will not be translated.
<DT><B>.hcode</B><I>&nbsp;c1&nbsp;code1&nbsp;c2&nbsp;code2...</I>

<DD>
Set the hyphenation code of character
<I>c1</I>

to
<I>code1</I>

and that of
<I>c2</I>

to
<I>code2</I>.

A hyphenation code must be a single input character (not a special
character) other than a digit or a space.
Initially each lower-case letter a-z has a hyphenation code, which is
itself, and each upper-case letter A-Z has a hyphenation code which is
the lower-case version of itself.
See also the
<B>hpf</B>

request.
<DT><B>.hla&nbsp;</B><I>lang</I>

<DD>
Set the current hyphenation language to
<I>lang</I>.

Hyphenation exceptions specified with the
<B>hw</B>

request and hyphenation patterns specified with the
<B>hpf</B>

request are both associated with the current hyphenation language.
The
<B>hla</B>

request is usually invoked by the
<B>troffrc</B>

file.
<DT><B>.hlm&nbsp;</B><I>n</I>

<DD>
Set the maximum number of consecutive hyphenated lines to~<I>n</I>.

If
<I>n</I>

is negative, there is no maximum.
The default value is~-1.
This value is associated with the current environment.
Only lines output from an environment count towards the maximum
associated with that environment.
Hyphens resulting from
<B>[rs]%</B>

are counted; explicit hyphens are not.
<DT><B>.hpf&nbsp;</B><I>file</I>

<DD>
Read hyphenation patterns from
<I>file</I>;

this will be searched for in the same way that
<I>name</I><B>.tmac</B>

is searched for when the
<B>-m</B><I>name</I>

option is specified.
It should have the same format as (simple) tx] patterns files.
More specifically, the following scanning rules are implemented.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>[bu]<DD>
A percent sign starts a comment (up to the end of the line) even if
preceded by a backslash.
<DT>[bu]<DD>
No support for `digraphs' like
<B>[rs]$</B>.

<DT>[bu]<DD>
<B>^^</B><I>xx</I>

(<I>x</I>

is 0-9 or a-f) and
<B>^^</B><I>x</I>

(character code of~<I>x</I>

in the range 0-127) are recognized; other use of
<B>^</B>

causes an error.
<DT>[bu]<DD>
No macro expansion.
<DT>[bu]<DD>
<B>hpf</B>

checks for the expression
<B>[rs]patterns{...}</B>

(possibly with whitespace before and after the braces).
Everything between the braces is taken as hyphenation patterns.
Consequently,
<B>{</B>

and
<B>}</B>

are not allowed in patterns.
<DT>[bu]<DD>
Similarly,
<B>[rs]hyphenation{...}</B>

gives a list of hyphenation exceptions.
<DT>[bu]<DD>
<B>[rs]endinput</B>

is recognized also.
<DT>[bu]<DD>
For backwards compatibility, if
<B>[rs]patterns</B>

is missing, the whole file is treated as a list of hyphenation patterns
(only recognizing the
<B>%</B>~character as the start of a comment).
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
Use the
<B>hpfcode</B>

request to map the encoding used in hyphenation patterns files to
<B>groff</B>'s

input encoding.
<DT><DD>
The set of hyphenation patterns is associated with the current language
set by the
<B>hla</B>

request.
The
<B>hpf</B>

request is usually invoked by the
<B>troffrc</B>

file; a second call replaces the old patterns with the new ones.
<DT><B>.hpfa&nbsp;</B><I>file</I>

<DD>
The same as
<B>hpf</B>

except that the hyphenation patterns from
<I>file</I>

are appended to the patterns already loaded in the current language.
<DT><B>.hpfcode&nbsp;</B><I>a&nbsp;b&nbsp;c&nbsp;d&nbsp;...</I>

<DD>
After reading a hyphenation patterns file with the
<B>hpf</B>

or
<B>hpfa</B>

request, convert all characters with character code~<I>a</I>

in the recently read patterns to character code~<I>b</I>,

character code~<I>c</I>

to~<I>d</I>,

etc.
Initially, all character codes map to themselves.
The arguments of
<B>hpfcode</B>

must be integers in the range 0 to~255.
Note that it is even possible to use character codes which are invalid in
<B>groff</B>

otherwise.
<DT><B>.hym&nbsp;</B><I>n</I>

<DD>
Set the
<I>hyphenation margin</I>

to~<I>n</I>:

when the current adjustment mode is not~<B>b</B>,

the line will not be hyphenated if the line is no more than
<I>n</I>

short.
The default hyphenation margin is~0.
The default scaling indicator for this request is~<I>m</I>.

The hyphenation margin is associated with the current environment.
The current hyphenation margin is available in the
<B>[rs]n[.hym]</B>

register.
<DT><B>.hys&nbsp;</B><I>n</I>

<DD>
Set the
<I>hyphenation space</I>

to~<I>n</I>:

when the current adjustment mode is~<B>b</B>

don't hyphenate the line if the line can be justified by adding no
more than
<I>n</I>

extra space to each word space.
The default hyphenation space is~0.
The default scaling indicator for this request is~<B>m</B>.

The hyphenation space is associated with the current environment.
The current hyphenation space is available in the
<B>[rs]n[.hys]</B>

register.
<DT><B>.itc&nbsp;</B><I>n&nbsp;macro</I>

<DD>
Variant of
<B>.it</B>

for which a line interrupted with
<B>[rs]c</B>

counts as one input line.
<DT><B>.kern&nbsp;</B><I>n</I>

<DD>
If
<I>n</I>

is non-zero or missing, enable pairwise kerning, otherwise disable it.
<DT><B>.length&nbsp;</B><I>xx&nbsp;string</I>

<DD>
Compute the length of
<I>string</I>

and return it in the number register
<I>xx</I>

(which is not necessarily defined before).
<DT><B>.linetabs&nbsp;</B><I>n</I>

<DD>
If
<I>n</I>

is non-zero or missing, enable line-tabs mode, otherwise disable it
(which is the default).
In line-tabs mode, tab distances are computed relative to the
(current) output line.
Otherwise they are taken relative to the input line.
For example, the following
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>


<PRE>

ייג=if

ייג=if

ייג=if

ייג=if

ייג=if

ייג=if

ייג=if
</PRE>


</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
yields
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
a         b         c
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
In line-tabs mode, the same code gives
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
a         b                   c
</DL>
</DL>

<DT><DD>
Line-tabs mode is associated with the current environment; the
read-only number register
<B>\[rs]n[.linetabs]</B>

is set to~1 if in line-tabs mode, and 0 otherwise.
<DT><B>.mso&nbsp;</B><I>file</I>

<DD>
The same as the
<B>so</B>

request except that
<I>file</I>

is searched for in the same directories as macro files for the the
<B>-m</B>

command line option.
If the file name to be included has the form
<I>name</I><B>.tmac</B>

and it isn't found,
<B>mso</B>

tries to include
<B>tmac.</B><I>name</I>

instead and vice versa.
<DT><B>.nop</B><I>&nbsp;anything</I>

<DD>
Execute
<I>anything</I>.

This is similar to `.if&nbsp;1'.
<DT><B>.nroff</B>

<DD>
Make the
<B>n</B>

built-in condition true and the
<B>t</B>

built-in condition false.
This can be reversed using the
<B>troff</B>

request.
<DT><B>.open&nbsp;</B><I>stream&nbsp;filename</I>

<DD>
Open
<I>filename</I>

for writing and associate the stream named
<I>stream</I>

with it.
See also the
<B>close</B>

and
<B>write</B>

requests.
<DT><B>.opena&nbsp;</B><I>stream&nbsp;filename</I>

<DD>
Like
<B>open</B>,

but if
<I>filename</I>

exists, append to it instead of truncating it.
<DT><B>.output&nbsp;</B><I>string</I>

<DD>
Emit
<I>string</I>

directly to the intermediate output (subject to copy-mode interpretation);
this is similar to
<B>[rs]!</B>

used at the top level.
An initial double quote in
<I>string</I>

is stripped off to allow initial blanks.
<DT><B>.pnr</B>

<DD>
Print the names and contents of all currently defined number registers
on stderr.
<DT><B>.psbb</B><I>&nbsp;filename</I>

<DD>
Get the bounding box of a PostScript image
<I>filename</I>.

This file must conform to Adobe's Document Structuring Conventions;
the command looks for a
<B>%%BoundingBox</B>

comment to extract the bounding box values.
After a successful call, the coordinates (in PostScript units) of the
lower left and upper right corner can be found in the registers
<B>[rs]n[llx]</B>,

<B>[rs]n[lly]</B>,

<B>[rs]n[urx]</B>,

and
<B>[rs]n[ury]</B>,

respectively.
If some error has occurred, the four registers are set to zero.
<DT><B>.pso</B><I>&nbsp;command</I>

<DD>
This behaves like the
<B>so</B>

request except that input comes from the standard output of
<I>command</I>.

<DT><B>.ptr</B>

<DD>
Print the names and positions of all traps (not including input line
traps and diversion traps) on stderr.
Empty slots in the page trap list are printed as well, because they
can affect the priority of subsequently planted traps.
<DT><B>.pvs</B><I>&nbsp;[+-]n</I>

<DD>
Set the post-vertical line space to
<I>n</I>;

default scale indicator is~<B>p</B>.

This value will be added to each line after it has been output.
With no argument, the post-vertical line space is set to its previous
value.
<DT><DD>
The total vertical line spacing consists of four components:
<B>.vs</B>

and
<B>[rs]x</B>

with a negative value which are applied before the line is output, and
<B>.pvs</B>

and
<B>[rs]x</B>

with a positive value which are applied after the line is output.
<DT><B>.rchar&nbsp;</B><I>c1&nbsp;c2...</I>

<DD>
Remove the definitions of characters
<I>c1</I>,

<I>c2</I>,...

This undoes the effect of a
<B>char</B>

request.
<DT><B>.return</B>

<DD>
Within a macro, return immediately.
No effect otherwise.
<DT><B>.rj</B>

<DD>

<BR>


<DT>

<B>.rj</B><I>~n</I>

<DD>Right justify the next
<I>n</I>~input lines.
Without an argument right justify the next input line.
The number of lines to be right justified is available in the
<B>[rs]n[.rj]</B>

register.
This implicitly does
<B>.ce</B>~0<B>.</B>

The
<B>ce</B>

request implicitly does
<B>.rj</B>~0<B>.</B>

<DT><B>.rnn</B><I>&nbsp;xx&nbsp;yy</I>

<DD>
Rename number register
<I>xx</I>

to
<I>yy</I>.

<DT><B>.shc&nbsp;</B><I>c</I>

<DD>
Set the soft hyphen character to
<I>c</I>.

If
<I>c</I>

is omitted, the soft hyphen character will be set to the default
<B>[rs](hy</B>.

The soft hyphen character is the character which will be inserted when
a word is hyphenated at a line break.
If the soft hyphen character does not exist in the font of the
character immediately preceding a potential break point, then the line
will not be broken at that point.
Neither definitions (specified with the
<B>char</B>

request) nor translations (specified with the
<B>tr</B>

request) are considered when finding the soft hyphen character.
<DT><B>.shift&nbsp;</B><I>n</I>

<DD>
In a macro, shift the arguments by
<I>n</I>

positions: argument~<I>i</I>

becomes argument
<I>i</I>-<I>n</I>;

arguments 1 to~<I>n</I>

will no longer be available.
If
<I>n</I>

is missing, arguments will be shifted by~1.
Shifting by negative amounts is currently undefined.
<DT><B>.sizes&nbsp;</B><I>s1&nbsp;s2...sn&nbsp;</I><B>[0]</B>

<DD>
This command is similar to the
<B>sizes</B>

command of a
<B>DESC</B>

file.
It sets the available font sizes for the current font to
<I>s1</I>,

<I>s2</I>,...,~<I>sn</I>

scaled points.
The list of sizes can be terminated by an optional~<B>0</B>.

Each
<I>si</I>

can also be a range of sizes
<I>m</I>-<I>n</I>.

Contrary to the font file command, the list can't extend over more
than a single line.
<DT><B>.special&nbsp;</B><I>s1&nbsp;s2...</I>

<DD>
Fonts
<I>s1</I>,

<I>s2</I>,

are special and will be searched for characters not in the current
font.
<DT><B>.spreadwarn&nbsp;</B><I>limit</I>

<DD>
Make
<B>troff</B>

emit a warning if the additional space inserted for each space between
words in an output line is larger or equal to
<I>limit</I>.

A negative value is changed to zero; no argument toggles the warning on
and off without changing
<I>limit</I>.

The default scaling indicator is~<B>m</B>.

At startup,
<B>spreadwarn</B>

is deactivated, and
<I>limit</I>

is set to 3m.
For example,
<B>.spreadwarn&nbsp;0.2m</B>

will cause a warning if
<B>troff</B>

must add 0.2m or more for each interword space in a line.
This request is active only if text is justified to both margins (using
<B>.ad&nbsp;b</B>).

<DT><B>.sty&nbsp;</B><I>n&nbsp;f</I>

<DD>
Associate style~<I>f</I>

with font position~<I>n</I>.

A font position can be associated either with a font or with a style.
The current font is the index of a font position and so is also either
a font or a style.
When it is a style, the font that is actually used is the font the
name of which is the concatenation of the name of the current family
and the name of the current style.
For example, if the current font is~1 and font position~1 is
associated with style~<B>R</B>

and the current font family is~<B>T</B>,

then font
<B>TR</B>

will be used.
If the current font is not a style, then the current family is ignored.
When the requests
<B>cs</B>,

<B>bd</B>,

<B>tkf</B>,

<B>uf</B>,

or
<B>fspecial</B>

are applied to a style, then they will instead be applied to the
member of the current family corresponding to that style.
The default family can be set with the
<B>-f</B>

option.
The
<B>styles</B>

command in the
<FONT SIZE="-1">DESC</FONT>
file controls which font positions (if any) are initially associated
with styles rather than fonts.
<DT><B>.substring&nbsp;</B><I>xx&nbsp;n1&nbsp;</I><B>[</B><I>n2</I><B>]</B>

<DD>
Replace the string named
<I>xx</I>

with the substring defined by the indices
<I>n1</I>

and
<I>n2</I>.

The first character in the string has index~0.
If
<I>n2</I>

is omitted, it is taken to be equal to the string's length.
If the index value
<I>n1</I>

or
<I>n2</I>

is negative, it will be counted from the end of the string,
going backwards:
The last character has index~-1, the character before the last
character has index~-2, etc.
<DT><B>.tkf&nbsp;</B><I>f&nbsp;s1&nbsp;n1&nbsp;s2&nbsp;n2</I>

<DD>
Enable track kerning for font
<I>f</I>.

When the current font is
<I>f</I>

the width of every character will be increased by an amount between
<I>n1</I>

and
<I>n2</I>;

when the current point size is less than or equal to
<I>s1</I>

the width will be increased by
<I>n1</I>;

when it is greater than or equal to
<I>s2</I>

the width will be increased by
<I>n2</I>;

when the point size is greater than or equal to
<I>s1</I>

and less than or equal to
<I>s2</I>

the increase in width is a linear function of the point size.
<DT><B>.tm1&nbsp;</B><I>string</I>

<DD>
Similar to the
<B>tm</B>

request,
<I>string</I>

is read in copy mode and written on the standard error, but an initial
double quote in
<I>string</I>

is stripped off to allow initial blanks.
<DT><B>.tmc&nbsp;</B><I>string</I>

<DD>
Similar to
<B>tm1</B>

but without writing a final newline.
<DT><B>.trf&nbsp;</B><I>filename</I>

<DD>
Transparently output the contents of file
<I>filename</I>.

Each line is output as if preceded by
<B>[rs]!</B>;

however, the lines are not subject to copy-mode interpretation.
If the file does not end with a newline, then a newline will be added.
For example, you can define a macro~<I>x</I>

containing the contents of file~<I>f</I>,

using

<FONT SIZE="-1">NUL</FONT>
that are not legal troff input characters.
<DT><B>.trin&nbsp;</B><I>abcd</I>

<DD>
This is the same as the
<B>tr</B>

<DT><B>.troff</B>

<DD>
Make the

<B>t</B>

built-in condition true.
This undoes the effect of the
<B>nroff</B>

request.
<DT><B>.unformat&nbsp;</B><I>xx</I>

<DD>
This request `unformats' the diversion
<I>xx</I>.

Contrary to the
<B>.asciify</B>

request, which tries to convert formatted elements of the diversion
back to input tokens as much as possible,
<B>.unformat</B>

will only handle tabs and spaces between words (usually caused by
spaces or newlines in the input) specially.
The former are treated as if they were input tokens, and the latter
are stretchable again.
Note that the vertical size of lines is not preserved.
Glyph information (font, font size, space width, etc.) is retained.
Useful in conjunction with the
<B>.box</B>

and
<B>.boxa</B>

requests.
<DT><B>.vpt&nbsp;</B><I>n</I>

<DD>
Enable vertical position traps if
<I>n</I>

is non-zero, disable them otherwise.
Vertical position traps are traps set by the
<B>wh</B>

or
<B>dt</B>

requests.
Traps set by the
<B>it</B>

request are not vertical position traps.
The parameter that controls whether vertical position traps are
enabled is global.
Initially vertical position traps are enabled.
<DT><B>.warn&nbsp;</B><I>n</I>

<DD>
Control warnings.
<I>n</I>

is the sum of the numbers associated with each warning that is to be
enabled; all other warnings will be disabled.
The number associated with each warning is listed in
<B><A HREF="/manpages/index.html?1+troff">troff</A></B>(1).

For example,
<B>.warn~0</B>

will disable all warnings, and
<B>.warn~1</B>

will disable all warnings except that about missing characters.
If
<I>n</I>

is not given, all warnings will be enabled.
<DT><B>.warnscale&nbsp;</B><I>si</I>

<DD>
Set the scaling indicator used in warnings to
<I>si</I>.

Valid values for
<I>si</I>

are
<B>u</B>,

<B>i</B>,

<B>c</B>,

<B>p</B>,

and
<B>P</B>.

At startup, it is set to~<B>i</B>.

<DT><B>.while</B><I>&nbsp;c&nbsp;anything</I>

<DD>
While condition~<I>c</I>

is true, accept
<I>anything</I>

as input;
<I>c</I>~can be any condition acceptable to an
<B>if</B>

request;
<I>anything</I>

can comprise multiple lines if the first line starts with
<B>[rs]{</B>

and the last line ends with
<B>[rs]}</B>.

<DT><B>.write&nbsp;</B><I>stream&nbsp;anything</I>

<DD>
Write

<I>stream</I>.

<I>stream</I>

must previously have been the subject of an
<B>open</B>

<I>anything</I>

is read in copy mode;
a leading~<B>[dq]</B>

<DT><B>.writec&nbsp;</B><I>stream&nbsp;anything</I>

<DD>
Similar to

but without writing a final newline.
<DT><B>.writem&nbsp;</B><I>stream&nbsp;xx</I>

<DD>
Write the contents of the macro or string
<I>xx</I>

<H3>Extended requests</H3>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>.cf&nbsp;</B><I>filename</I>

<DD>
When used in a diversion, this will embed in the diversion an object
which, when reread, will cause the contents of
<I>filename</I>

to be transparently copied through to the output.
In UNIX troff, the contents of
<I>filename</I>

is immediately copied through to the output regardless of whether
there is a current diversion; this behaviour is so anomalous that it
must be considered a bug.
<DT><B>.ev&nbsp;</B><I>xx</I>

<DD>
If
<I>xx</I>

is not a number, this will switch to a named environment called
<I>xx</I>.

The environment should be popped with a matching
<B>ev</B>

request without any arguments, just as for numbered environments.
There is no limit on the number of named environments; they will be
created the first time that they are referenced.
<DT><B>.ss&nbsp;</B><I>m&nbsp;n</I>

<DD>
When two arguments are given to the
<B>ss</B>

request, the second argument gives the
<I>sentence space size</I>.

If the second argument is not given, the sentence space size
will be the same as the word space size.
Like the word space size, the sentence space is in units of
one twelfth of the spacewidth parameter for the current font.
Initially both the word space size and the sentence
space size are~12.
Contrary to UNIX troff, GNU troff handles this request in nroff mode
also; a given value is then rounded down to the nearest multiple
of~12.
The sentence space size is used in two circumstances.
If the end of a sentence occurs at the end of a line in fill mode,
then both an inter-word space and a sentence space will be added; if
two spaces follow the end of a sentence in the middle of a line, then
the second space will be a sentence space.
Note that the behaviour of UNIX troff will be exactly that exhibited
by GNU troff if a second argument is never given to the
<B>ss</B>

request.
In GNU troff, as in UNIX troff, you should always follow a sentence
with either a newline or two spaces.
<DT><B>.ta&nbsp;</B><I>n1&nbsp;n2...nn</I><B>&nbsp;T&nbsp;</B><I>r1&nbsp;r2...rn</I>

</DL>
<A NAME="lbAL">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Miscellaneous</H3>


<B>troff</B>

predefines a single (read/write) string-based register,
<B>[rs]*(.T</B>,

which contains the argument given to the
<B>-T</B>

command line option, namely the current output device (for example,
<I>latin1</I>

or
<I>ascii</I>).

Note that this is not the same as the (read-only) number register
<B>[rs]n[.T]</B>

which is defined to be~1 if
<B>troff</B>

is called with the
<B>-T</B>

command line option, and zero otherwise.
This behaviour is different to UNIX troff.

Fonts not listed in the
<FONT SIZE="-1">DESC</FONT>
file are automatically mounted on the next available font position
when they are referenced.
If a font is to be mounted explicitly with the
<B>fp</B>

request on an unused font position, it should be mounted on the first
unused font position, which can be found in the
<B>[rs]n[.fp]</B>

register; although
<B>troff</B>

does not enforce this strictly, it will not allow a font to be mounted
at a position whose number is much greater than that of any currently
used position.

Interpolating a string does not hide existing macro arguments.
Thus in a macro, a more efficient way of doing
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
<B>.</B><I>xx&nbsp;</I><B>[rs][rs]$@</B>


is
<DT><DD>
<B>[rs][rs]*[</B><I>xx</I><B>][rs][rs]</B>


If the font description file contains pairwise kerning information,
characters from that font will be kerned.
Kerning between two characters can be inhibited by placing a
<B>[rs]&amp;</B>

between them.

In a string comparison in a condition, characters that appear at
different input levels to the first delimiter character will not be
recognised as the second or third delimiters.
This applies also to the
<B>tl</B>

request.
In a
<B>[rs]w</B>

escape sequence, a character that appears at a different input level
to the starting delimiter character will not be recognised as the
closing delimiter character.
The same is true for
<B>[rs]A</B>,

<B>[rs]b</B>,

<B>[rs]B</B>,

<B>[rs]C</B>,

<B>[rs]l</B>,

<B>[rs]L</B>,

<B>[rs]o</B>,

<B>[rs]X</B>,

and
<B>[rs]Z</B>.

When decoding a macro or string argument that is delimited by double
quotes, a character that appears at a different input level to the starting
delimiter character will not be recognised as the closing delimiter
character.
The implementation of
<B>[rs]$@</B>

ensures that the double quotes surrounding an argument will appear the
same input level, which will be different to the input level of the
argument itself.
In a long escape name
<B>]</B>

will not be recognized as a closing delimiter except when it occurs at
the same input level as the opening
<B>]</B>.

In compatibility mode, no attention is paid to the input-level.

There are some new types of condition:
<DT><B>.if&nbsp;r</B><I>xxx</I>

<DD>
True if there is a number register named
<I>xxx</I>.

<DT><B>.if&nbsp;d</B><I>xxx</I>

<DD>
True if there is a string, macro, diversion, or request named
<I>xxx</I>.

<DT><B>.if&nbsp;m</B><I>xxx</I>

<DD>
True if there is a color named
<I>xxx</I>.

<DT><B>.if&nbsp;c</B><I>ch</I>

<DD>
True if there is a character
<I>ch</I>

available;
<I>ch</I>

is either an
<FONT SIZE="-1">ASCII</FONT>
character or a special character
<B>[rs](</B><I>xx</I>

or
<B>[rs][</B><I>xxx</I><B>]</B>R];

the condition will also be true if
<I>ch</I>

has been defined by the
<B>char</B>

request.

The
<B>tr</B>

request can now map characters onto
<B>[rs]~</B>.


It is now possible to have whitespace between the first and second dot
(or the name of the ending macro) to end a macro definition.

<H2>INTERMEDIATE OUTPUT FORMAT</H2>


This section describes the format output by GNU troff.
The output format used by GNU troff is very similar to that used
by Unix device-independent troff.
Only the differences are documented here.

<A NAME="lbAN">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Units</H3>


The argument to the
<B>s</B>

command is in scaled points (units of
points/<I>n</I>,

where
<I>n</I>

is the argument to the
<B>sizescale</B>

command  in the DESC file).
The argument to the
<B>x&nbsp;Height</B>

command is also in scaled points.

<A NAME="lbAO">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Text Commands</H3>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>N</B><I>n</I>

<DD>
Print character with index~<I>n</I>

(a non-negative integer) of the current font.

If the
<B>tcommand</B>

line is present in the DESC file, troff will use the following two
commands.
<DT><B>t</B><I>xxx</I>

<DD>
<I>xxx</I>

is any sequence of characters terminated by a space or a newline; the
first character should be printed at the current position, the current
horizontal position should be increased by the width of the first
character, and so on for each character.
The width of the character is that given in the font file,
appropriately scaled for the current point size, and rounded so that
it is a multiple of the horizontal resolution.
Special characters cannot be printed using this command.
<DT><B>u</B><I>n&nbsp;xxx</I>

<DD>
This is same as the
<B>t</B>

command except that after printing each character, the current
horizontal position is increased by the sum of the width of that
character and
<I>n</I>.


Note that single characters can have the eighth bit set, as can the
names of fonts and special characters.

The names of characters and fonts can be of arbitrary length; drivers
should not assume that they will be only two characters long.

When a character is to be printed, that character will always be
in the current font.
Unlike device-independent troff, it is not necessary for drivers to
search special fonts to find a character.

For color support, some new commands have been added:

Set the shade of gray to be used for filling solid objects to
<I>n</I>;

<I>n</I>

must be an integer between 0 and 1000, where 0 corresponds solid white
and 1000 to solid black, and values in between correspond to
intermediate shades of gray.
This applies only to solid circles, solid ellipses and solid
polygons.
By default, a level of 1000 will be used.
Whatever color a solid object has, it should completely obscure
everything beneath it.
A value greater than 1000 or less than 0 can also be used: this means
fill with the shade of gray that is currently being used for lines and

Normally this will be black, but some drivers may provide a way of
changing this.

<DT>
ייג=if


<DD>
Draw a polygon with, for $i = 1 ,..., n+1$, the
<I>i</I>-th

vertex at the current position 
$+ sum from j=1 to i-1 ( dx sub j , dy sub j )$.
At the moment, GNU pic only uses this command to generate triangles
and rectangles.
<DT>
ייג=if


<DD>
Like
<B>Dp</B>

but draw a solid rather than outlined polygon.
<DT>
ייג=if


<DD>
Set the current line thickness to
<I>n</I>

machine units.
Traditionally Unix troff drivers use a line thickness proportional to
the current point size; drivers should continue to do this if no
<B>Dt</B>

command has been given, or if a
<B>Dt</B>

command has been given with a negative value of
<I>n</I>.

A zero value of
<I>n</I>

selects the smallest available line thickness.

A difficulty arises in how the current position should be changed after
the execution of these commands.
This is not of great importance since the code generated by GNU pic
does not depend on this.
Given a drawing command of the form
<DT><DD>
B][rs]D[fm]I]cR] $x sub 1$ $y sub 1$ $x sub 2$ $y sub 2$ $...$ $x sub n$ $y sub n$[fm]

where
<I>c</I>

is not one of
<B>c</B>,

<B>e</B>,

<B>l</B>,

<B>a</B>,

or
<B>~</B>,

Unix troff will treat each of the $x sub i$ as a horizontal quantity,
and each of the $y sub i$ as a vertical quantity and will assume that
the width of the drawn object is $sum from i=1 to n x sub i$,
and that the height is $sum from i=1 to n y sub i$.
(The assumption about the height can be seen by examining the
<B>st</B>

and
<B>sb</B>

registers after using such a
<B>D</B>

command in a [rs]w escape sequence).
This rule also holds for all the original drawing commands with the
exception of
<B>De</B>.

For the sake of compatibility GNU troff also follows this rule, even
though it produces an ugly result in the case of the
<B>Dt</B>,

and, to a lesser extent,
<B>DE</B>

commands.
Thus after executing a
<B>D</B>

command of the form
<DT><DD>
B]DI]cR] $x sub 1$ $y sub 1$ $x sub 2$ $y sub 2$ $...$ $x sub n$ $y sub n$[rs]n

the current position should be increased by
$( sum from i=1 to n x sub i , sum from i=1 to n y sub i )$.

<A NAME="lbAQ">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Device Control Commands</H3>


There is a continuation convention which permits the argument to the
<B>x&nbsp;X</B>

command to contain newlines: when outputting the argument to the
<B>x&nbsp;X</B>

command, GNU troff will follow each newline in the argument with a
<B>+</B>

character (as usual, it will terminate the entire argument with a
newline); thus if the line after the line containing the
<B>x&nbsp;X</B>

command starts with
<B>+</B>,

then the newline ending the line containing the
<B>x&nbsp;X</B>

command should be treated as part of the argument to the
<B>x&nbsp;X</B>

command, the
<B>+</B>

should be ignored, and the part of the line following the
<B>+</B>

should be treated like the part of the line following the
<B>x&nbsp;X</B>

command.

The first three output commands are guaranteed to be:

<H2>INCOMPATIBILITIES</H2>


In spite of the many extensions, groff has retained compatibility to
classical troff to a large degree.
For the cases where the extensions lead to collisions, a special
compatibility mode with the restricted, old functionality was created
for groff.

<A NAME="lbAS">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Groff Language</H3>


<I>groff</I>

provides a
<B>compatibility mode</B>

that allows to process roff code written for classical

or for other implementations of roff in a consistent way.

Compatibility mode can be turned on with the

command line option, and turned on or off with the





ייג=if




request.
The number register





ייג=if




is~1 if compatibility mode is on, 0~otherwise.

This became necessary because the GNU concept for long names causes
some incompatibilities.
<I>Classical troff</I>

interprets
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>





ייג=if





as defining a string
<B>ab</B>

with contents
<B>cd</B>.

In
<I>groff</I>

mode, this will be considered as a call of a macro named





ייג=if





Also
<I>classical troff</I>

interprets





ייג=if




or





ייג=if




as references to a string or number register called





ייג=if




while
<I>groff</I>

takes this as the start of a long name.

In
<I>compatibility mode</I>,

groff interprets these things in the traditional way; so long
names are not recognized.

On the other hand, groff in
<I>GNU native mode</I>

does not allow to use the single-character escapes





ייג=if




(backslash),





ייג=if




(vertical bar),





ייג=if




(caret),





ייג=if




(ampersand),





ייג=if




(opening brace),





ייג=if




(closing brace),





ייג=if




(space),





ייג=if




(single quote),





ייג=if




(backquote),





ייג=if




(minus),





ייג=if




(underline),





ייג=if




(bang),





ייג=if




(percent),
and





ייג=if




(character c) in names of strings, macros, diversions, number
registers, fonts or environments, whereas
<I>classical troff</I>

does.

The





ייג=if




escape sequence can be helpful in avoiding these escape sequences in
names.

Fractional pointsizes cause one noteworthy incompatibility.
In
<I>classical</I>

<I>troff</I>,

the





ייג=if




request ignores scale indicators and so
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

<B>.ps~10u</B>

</DL>


will set the pointsize to 10~points, whereas in groff native mode the
pointsize will be set to 10~scaled points.

In
<I>groff</I>

mode, there is a fundamental difference between unformatted input
characters, and formatted output characters.
Everything that affects how an output character will be output is
stored with the character; once an output character has been
constructed it is unaffected by any subsequent requests that are
executed, including the





ייג=if









ייג=if









ייג=if









ייג=if




or





ייג=if




requests.

Normally output characters are constructed from input characters at
the moment immediately before the character is added to the current
output line.
Macros, diversions and strings are all, in fact, the same type of
object; they contain lists of input characters and output characters
in any combination.

An output character does not behave like an input character for the
purposes of macro processing; it does not inherit any of the special
properties that the input character from which it was constructed
might have had.
The following example will make things clearer.

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>

ייג=if

ייג=if

ייג=if

ייג=if

ייג=if
</PRE>

</DL>


In
<I>GNU mode</I>

this will be printed as





ייג=if




So each pair of input backslashes





ייג=if




is turned into a single output backslash





ייג=if




and the resulting output backslashes are not interpreted as escape
characters when they are reread.

<I>Classical troff</I>

would interpret them as escape characters when they were reread and
would end up printing a single backslash





ייג=if





In GNU, the correct way to get a printable version of the backslash
character





ייג=if




is the





ייג=if




escape sequence, but classical troff does not provide a clean feature
for getting a non-syntactical backslash.
A close method is the printable version of the current escape
character using the





ייג=if




escape sequence; this works if the current escape character is not
redefined.
It works in both GNU mode and compatibility mode, while dirty tricks
like specifying a sequence of multiple backslashes do not work
reliably; for the different handling in diversions, macro definitions,
or text mode quickly leads to a confusion about the necessary number of
backslashes.

To store an escape sequence in a diversion that will be interpreted
when the diversion is reread, either the traditional





ייג=if




transparent output facility or the
new





ייג=if




escape sequence can be used.

<A NAME="lbAT">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Intermediate Output</H3>


The groff intermediate output format is in a state of evolution.
So far it has some incompatibilities, but it is intended to establish
a full compatibility to the classical troff output format.
Actually the following incompatibilities exist:

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
ייג=if


<DD>

The positioning after the drawing of the polygons conflicts with the
classical definition.

<DT>
ייג=if


<DD>

The intermediate output cannot be rescaled to other devices as
classical &quot;device-independent&quot; troff did.
